## 🔹 try
- Used to run code that **might cause an error**
- JavaScript checks this block first
- If no error → code runs normally

## 🔹 catch
- Runs **only when an error occurs in try**
- Used to **handle errors gracefully**
- Prevents the program from crashing

## 🔹 fetch
- A **Web API** used to **get or send data from a server**
- Commonly used for API calls
- Always **returns a Promise**
- Data is usually received in **JSON format**

---

## 🔁 How They Work Together
- `fetch` performs async operations
- `try` tests the risky async code
- `catch` handles any errors

---

## ⭐ Easy to Remember
- **try** → test risky code  
- **catch** → handle errors  
- **fetch** → get server data  
```
